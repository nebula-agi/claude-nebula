# Super Search

Search Nebula for past coding sessions, decisions, and saved information using semantic similarity.

## How to Search

Run the search script with the user's query:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/search-memory.cjs" "USER_QUERY_HERE"
```

Replace `USER_QUERY_HERE` with what the user is searching for.

## Examples

- User asks "what did I work on yesterday":
  ```bash
  node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/search-memory.cjs" "work yesterday recent activity"
  ```

- User asks "how did I implement auth":
  ```bash
  node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/search-memory.cjs" "authentication implementation"
  ```

## Present Results

The script outputs formatted memory results. Present them clearly to the user and offer to search again with different terms if needed.
